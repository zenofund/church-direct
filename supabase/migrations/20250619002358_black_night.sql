  # Admin User Setup Instructions

  This migration provides instructions for creating an admin user.
  Since auth users cannot be created directly through SQL migrations,
  you need to create the auth user manually first.

  ## Steps to create admin user:
  
  1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
  2. Click "Add user" and create:
     - Email: zenofund@gmail.com  
     - Password: ZUngwenen27@@##
  3. After creating the auth user, the user profile will be automatically 
     created through the existing trigger system
  4. The first user will automatically become an admin due to the 
     create_initial_admin_trigger

  ## Alternative: Manual Profile Creation
  
  If you need to manually promote an existing user to admin,
  you can run this query in the SQL editor (replace USER_ID with actual ID):
  
  UPDATE user_profiles 
  SET role = 'admin', status = 'approved' 
  WHERE email = 'zenofund@gmail.com';
*/

-- This migration file serves as documentation for admin user creation
-- No actual SQL changes are needed as the trigger system handles user profile creation
-- and the first user automatically becomes an admin

-- Verify that the admin creation trigger exists
